# flux++
Home Assistant custom component to let colored lights follow the day's and circadian rhythm.

This is heavily based on the original Flux component in Home Assistant: https://home-assistant.io/components/switch.flux/

## Improvements:
  - Lights that have their color changed manually will not be updated
  - New service 'force_update' to have all lights in the Flux++ switch 
    which are turned on participate in the future updates again
  - New functionality to listen for newly turned on slights that are 
    part of the Flux++ switch. Newly turned on lights will be updated
    to the flux color and participate in future updates
  - New conf parameter init_on_turn_on to define if newly turned on
    lights shall participate and be reset to the flux color or not
  - It is now possible to call the 'force_update' service specifying 
    one or more entity_ids of the lights that should be updated. 
    If no entities are given, all lights in the flux switch will be 
    updated

## Installation:
  To install flux++
   - create a folder 'custom_components\switch' under your Home Assistant config direcctory.
   - download and copy the file 'flux++.py' into this directory.
   - add the definition on which lights to include in the flux automatic updates with the following section in 'configuration.yaml'.

# Shortcomings: 
This has currently only been fully tested with Philips Hue bulbs with the mired color selection mode.
I would love to get feedback from others to know if this works with other bulb types.
